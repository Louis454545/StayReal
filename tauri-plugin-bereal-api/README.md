# `tauri-plugin-bereal-api`

A plugin for interacting natively with the BeReal API.

## Motivation

Tauri can't really do background tasks to fetch data from the BeReal API, so this plugin is a workaround to fetch data from the BeReal API in native code.

## Features

- [ ] Check every 5 minutes for the BeReal Moment API
- [ ] Refresh your feed and tell whenever an action is done
