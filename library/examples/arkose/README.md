# Arkose Challenge Token - Example implementation

## Usage

```bash
npx serve .
```

You can now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the example in action.

If everything goes well, you should have a prompt showing up saying "session token", you can copy its content and paste it in the `.env` file for the `ARKOSE_TOKEN` variable.

**Note that the token is only valid for a few minutes**, so you might need to refresh the page to get a new one.
